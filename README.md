# Personal website
Hi! this is the repo of my personal website. Here I put on some of my expirence and fun personal projects I've made. You can check out the running page [here](https://narias1999.github.io/).  

I've made this project with pure css and html seeking for a better performance.  

Feel free to use it to build you own page :)
